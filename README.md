# BashLikeShellProject
This is a CSE3033 - Operating Systems term project that was written on C language that implements a basic level shell like Linux bash.
The capabilities of this shell are :
- Executing base command executables with arguments given
- Foreground/background process execution with over control on taking a background process to foreground
- Input output redirections
- "history" command that is purely implemented inside the code
